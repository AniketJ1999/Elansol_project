To run the application we need to run following commands:
Firtly in main directory run: 
       cd backend
       npm i mongoose express jsonwebtoken nodemon cors bcrypt cookie-parser
this will ensure that we have all the dependencies to start server.
Then run: 
       node index.js

After server is running we need to start application by running following commands in new terminal:
       cd frontend
       npm i axios bootstrap@latest react-icons react-cookie react-toastify
       npm start

With these process the application should be now running.
Thanks
